## Paul Martin

I am a full stack developer looking for a role where I can continue to develop my learning and face new challenges in a collaborative environment.

I graduated from Cambridge University with a BA in Mathematics, and have worked as a self-taught freelance web developer, and as a UI designer and tester working in a small development team.

I am currently training at Makers Academy, an intensive coding bootcamp, to put my developer skills on a more professional level - one of the best decisions I've ever made! I love the constant new challenges presented on the course, the collaborative learning and the focus on coding best practices. I am looking for a job where I can continue this learning experience.

## Skills

#### Fast, independent learner

At Makers Academy we have been introduced to new technologies and ways of working on a weekly basis. In addition to this I have challenged myself by taking on extra exercises to develop my learning skills, such as when I [repeated one of the early challenges in Java](https://github.com/Hives/airport-challenge-java), a language I had never used before, and when I worked on the [Gilded Rose refactoring kata in C#](https://github.com/Hives/gilded-rose-csharp), another new language.

Before attending Makers I also taught myself web development technologies such as JavaScript, HTML/CSS, PHP (Wordpress and Drupal).

#### Test-driven development

All my projects at Makers have been test-driven, using a variety of frameworks including one I developed myself. In my group work I have advocated for a good TDD process by insisting we delete spiked code written while learning new technology and test-driving it from scratch.

#### Collaboration

Pair programming is a fundamental part of the Makers course, and is now integral to my idea of good teamwork. I believe good pairing is a great way to develop and share knowledge, increase engagement within a team, and write the best quality code. In my teamwork I have prioritised collaboration by setting up project wikis and encouraging team members to use them to share their learning, and by organising knowledge sharing workshops.

#### Communication

I have excellent communication skills, and am able to communicate complex ideas verbally and by diagramming. Throughout the Makers course I have received positive feedback from my pair partners about my ability to explain and break down programming concepts, and my patience when doing so. In my work for Jellymould I wrote detailed feature specifications for our developer to work on, which he said were clear and precise.

#### Methodical approach to problem solving

My approach to solving problems is always to break them down and look for the simplest solution. When working for Jellymould Creative I often found ways to break large projects down into smaller chunks which could be delivered iteratively, or to find a simplified approach which achieved most of what the client required but could be delivered more quickly.

#### Codewars

I've got a score of 1,966 on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Hives)... I kind of want to put this in here somewhere but I'm not sure where it goes...
